Scotch and its creative "inhabitants" have been an amazing help in seeing AngularJS in a different, creative way:

http://scotch.io/tag/angular-js
https://scotch.io/tutorials/all-about-the-built-in-angularjs-filters
https://scotch.io/tutorials/animating-angular-apps-ngshow-and-nghide

From separate Notes: (these were not in the GitHub this whole time)
DO NOT FORGET "NG-APP" AT HTML!!!!

cdnjs.com for script references: not just angular, easeljs and even css

"Automagically"

Angular expression filters => common practice to insert directly into HTML View

variables in clickable a's => use ng-href instead of standard href

dynamically loading css => awesome shizzle https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-angularjs-and-nghref-to-grab-css-dynamically

ng-options="bootstrap.url as bootstrap.name for bootstrap in bootstraps"

ng-src: use this if you wish to do stuff with images (like ng-show/hide)

Less code to write, means less code to test, means less code to debug, means less code to maintain.


I'm probably forgetting a few things, or left some out, I've been trying and experimenting, there's more in the full report:(wouterjansen1.mctantwerpen.be/docs/VerslagAngularJSWouterJansen.pdf)
